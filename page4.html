<h1>Server Approval Requirements</h1>
<p>A server that is approved will have a green "Approved" check mark next to the server name on all pages of this site. To get your server approved, a number of things must happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Either A) You need to join the BMH Discord Server and ask a moderator to start the approval process, or B) someone must reccomend your server on this website.</li>
<li>After that, the moderators will begin their review of your server. To begin the approval process, a moderator or moderators will ask for an invite to your server. You must remove any "Newcomer" role, and give the moderator a "Spectator" or "Observer" role.</li>
<li>A moderator will take into account the following parts of your server: Member count, type of server, current server life, moderation, organization, history, activity.</li>
<li>After the approval process (could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days), the moderator(s)will make a decision on your server, and you will be given an answer.</li>
<li>Even if the answer is no, your server may still be displayed on our site. However, there will only be basic info from your server on our site.</li>
<li>If your server is approved, you will have the ability to have a custom advertisement displayed on the server page of the website, as well as having an invite link being posted directly on your page.</li>
</ul>
